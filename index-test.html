            <h3>The Importance of National Parks</h3>
            <p>The remarkable landscapes and features of nature preserved in national parks have the power to awaken an extraordinary sense of wonder. The ethereal rise of a peak in mist, the smooth glide of an eagle in flight, the bright slant of sunbeams piercing the depths of a primeval forest -- such glimpses of natural beauty can move people in inexplicable ways. National parks transport visitors far outside the confines of routine existence, to awe-inspiring realms of mystery and splendor, governed by forces beyond our control. By coming to national parks, many seek to transcend the superficial distractions that clutter daily life and experience something of deeper, enduring value. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Indeed, these sanctuaries of unspoiled nature represent places of spiritual renewal where we can return to the source of our being and recover the freshness of a new beginning. National parks enshrine important American values and aspirations. The high peaks and deep canyons of parks such as Alaska’s Denali and the Grand Canyon embody the majesty and grandeur of the United States extolled in the national hymn “America the Beautiful.” The vast landscapes and untrammeled places preserved within the National Park System serve as reminders of the quest for freedom and independence that lies at the heart of American culture and history. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            High mountains and remote wilderness areas in parks such as Grand Teton [Wyoming], North Cascades [Washington], and Wrangell-St. Elias [Alaska] provide opportunities for the kinds of challenge and adventure that build character and contribute to America’s can-do spirit. Many go to primeval forests and quiet spots in Redwood [California], Rocky Mountain [Colorado], and other national parks as natural cathedrals, seeking to find peace and contemplation -- and to recover a sense of who they are and what is important in life.

            <h3>The National Park Sevice</h3>
            <p>The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world. <br>
            <br>
            Since 1916, the National Park Service has been entrusted with the care of our national parks.With the help of volunteers and partners, they safeguard these special places and share their stories with more than 275 million visitors every year. The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all U.S. national parks, many American national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations. It was created on August 25, 1916, by Congress through the National Park Service Organic Act and is an agency of the United States Department of the Interior. The NPS is charged with a dual role of preserving the ecological and historical integrity of the places entrusted to its management while also making them available and accessible for public use and enjoyment.
            <br>
            <br>
            As of 2014, the NPS employs 21,651 employees who oversee 417 units, of which 59 are designated national parks.
            <br>
            <br>
            The National Park Service celebrated its centennial in 2016.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>By the Act of March 1, 1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park in the Territories of Montana and Wyoming "as a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people" and placed it "under exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior." The founding of Yellowstone National Park began a worldwide national park movement. Today more than 100 nations contain some 1,200 national parks or equivalent preserves.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the years following the establishment of Yellowstone, the United States authorized additional national parks and monuments, many of them carved from the federal lands of the West. These, also, were administered by the Department of the Interior, while other monuments and natural and historical areas were administered by the War Department and the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture. No single agency provided unified management of the varied federal parklands.
            <br>
            <br>
            The National Park System of the United States became comprised of and still comprises more than 400 areas covering more than 84 million acres in 50 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Saipan, and the Virgin Islands. These areas are of such national significance as to justify special recognition and protection in accordance with various acts of Congress.
            <br>
            <br>
            The National Park Service still strives to meet its original goals, while filling many other roles as well: guardian of our diverse cultural and recreational resources; environmental advocate; partner in community revitalization, world leader in the parks and preservation community; and pioneer in the drive to protect America's open space.
            <br>
            Today more than 20,000 National Park Service employees care for America's 400+ national parks and work with communities across the nation to help preserve local history and create close-to-home recreational opportunities.
